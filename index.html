<h1>Welcome to the Cool people webring!</h1>
<p>
  What is a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring>webring</a> ?.<br>
  Conallia made this webring, view my site here --> <a href="https://conallia.neocities.org">https://conallia.neocities.org</a> <br>
  Cool people webring is an invite only webring filled with cool people. Once you become a member, you are allowed to invite anyone. This webring doesn't really have much of a theme, although I assume it will mostly be made up of personal websites.

<p>If the ring is broken, please <a href={{site.github_repo_url}}/issues/new>submit an error report on GitHub</a>.
